# Deciphering Key Descriptors for Scaling Relationships in Graphene-Supported Ptₙ Clusters (Pt<sub>n</sub>) via Machine Learning"

Subnanometer Pt clusters are promising electrocatalysts because they enable high noble-metal utilization and can exhibit unusually high activity. However, unlike extended surfaces, these clusters are highly fluxional, strongly isomer-dependent, and often deviate from conventional scaling relationships, making accurate activity prediction challenging. In this work, we develop a combined DFT and machine learning (ML) framework to uncover the geometric origin of non-scaling behavior in the subnanometer regime. Feature-driven uncertainty and interpretability analyses identify the perpendicular distance between the active Pt atom and the graphene surface (Z) as the most influential descriptor governing the breakdown of scaling relations. Beyond single-intermediate adsorption, we further assess realistic ORR conditions by considering higher intermediate coverages. Thermodynamic analysis reveals a strong oxidative tendency of supported Pt clusters, favoring oxygen monolayer formation, which increases ORR overpotentials relative to bare clusters and highlights the critical role of coverage-dependent structural evolution in supported subnanometer electrocatalysts.
