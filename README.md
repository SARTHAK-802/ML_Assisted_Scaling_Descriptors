## Background / Associated Study

### **Deciphering Key Descriptors for Scaling Relationships in Graphene-Supported Pt<sub>n</sub> Clusters via Machine Learning**

Subnanometer Pt clusters are promising electrocatalysts because they enable high noble-metal utilization and can exhibit unusually high activity. However, unlike extended surfaces, these clusters are highly fluxional, strongly isomer-dependent, and often deviate from conventional scaling relationships, making accurate activity prediction challenging. In our work, we develop a combined **DFT and machine learning (ML)** framework to uncover the **geometric origin of non-scaling behavior** in the subnanometer regime. Feature-driven uncertainty and interpretability analyses identify the perpendicular distance between the active Pt atom and the graphene surface (**Z**) as the most influential descriptor governing the breakdown of scaling relations. Beyond single-intermediate adsorption, we further assess realistic ORR conditions by considering higher intermediate coverages. Thermodynamic analysis reveals a strong oxidative tendency of supported Pt clusters, favoring oxygen monolayer formation, which increases ORR overpotentials relative to bare clusters and highlights the critical role of coverage-dependent structural evolution in supported subnanometer electrocatalysts.
