# Deciphering Key Descriptors for Scaling Relationships in Graphene-Supported Ptₙ Clusters (Pt₇–Pt₁₃) via Machine Learning

This repository contains the **atomic coordinates (structures)** of the **global minima (GMs)** along with the corresponding **low-lying local minima (LMs)** for **graphene-supported Ptₙ clusters (n = 7–13)**, generated from systematic **global optimization** searches.

The structures provided here are used in our accompanying manuscript:

**“Deciphering Key Descriptors for Scaling Relationships in Graphene-Supported Ptₙ Clusters via Machine Learning”** :contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}

## Contents of this Repository

- **Pt₇–Pt₁₃ / Graphene-supported clusters**
- For each Ptₙ size:
  - **GM (Global Minimum) structure**
  - **LM (Local Minimum) structures** within the low-energy ensemble

✅ **All the local minima included are within 0.4 eV energy difference from the GM.**

## Scientific Context (Brief)

Subnanometer Pt clusters supported on graphene exhibit:
- Strong **fluxionality** (multiple accessible isomers)
- Highly **heterogeneous active sites**
- **Non-monotonic ORR activity**
- Breaking of traditional **scaling relationships** in the subnanometer regime

The dataset in this repository provides the **structural foundation** for adsorption-energy modeling and machine-learning descriptor analysis reported in the manuscript. :contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}

## File Formats

The coordinates are provided as geometry files suitable for use in atomistic simulations (e.g., DFT calculations in VASP/ASE workflows).  
(Refer to folder structure for exact formats and naming.)
